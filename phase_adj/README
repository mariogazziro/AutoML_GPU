CUDA NMR Phase Adjust

The problem of phase adjustment in NMR spectroscopy signals did not have robust solutions until today,
especially in the case of noisy signals. We present in this work a novel solution, which runs through the
entire possible phase space using massively parallel processing of GPUs, determining the best set for the
adjustment of these signals, faster than conventional CPUs. The speed-ups registered are at least ve
times. Besides, we present a case study showing the robustness of the proposed method against minimum
local situations during the search for the best solution. Finally, a Bland-Altman analysis was performed,
validating the entropies calculated by CPU and GPU in a set of 16 experiments using 1H and 31P probes.
